**Churn Analysis**

A comprehensive churn analysis dashboard for a telco company, highlighting key metrics such as total customers, new joiners, churn rate, and customer demographics.
By uncovering hidden patterns in customer behavior, I have identified key drivers of churn and opportunities for improvement.

**Key findings:**
Churn Rate by Demographics and Geographic 

The overall churn rate is 27%.

Churn rate in females was higher (64.15%) than in male (35.85%).

Clients under the age cohort of 50 and above churned more representing a churn rate of 31.6%.

The leading state in churn rate was Jammu at 57.2%.

Monthly contract clients churned more at a rate of 37.8%.

Churn Rate By services: Fibre optic services suffered a higher churn rate of 41.1%

**Churn Reasons:**
1.	The main reason for churn was under competitor.
        Drilling deeper using a tool tip we found out that the competitor had better devices, better offers, higher download speeds and offered more data.
   
2.	The second main reason for churn was attitude of the service providers and support staff.
   
**Recommendations:**
Focus on high-value segments by offering these customers/regions exclusive perks and personalized promotions.

Enhance fibre optic services.

Invest in exceptional customer service and aim to create a more loyal customer base.

Improve the marketing and retention Strategies.
